    Spawn expects a state of the world. It doesn't need to be a completely known state of the world (I think) but because I expect
    this function to be used by the simulator which is omniscient and not the agent which has limited knolwedge, spawn must be able to
    deal with a complete state, all n of its attributes.
    
    State must be a dictionary. Right now there may be two representations of states floating around, dictionaries and 2D grids. There are functions that transform
    one format to the other but which functions prefer which versions? I don't want to worry about this but ... sigh.
