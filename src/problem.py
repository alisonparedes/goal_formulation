Transition expects a state and an action and returns a state and an observation. The problem spec helps determine how
the state changes.

A state is made up of three features: ...

Action determine which of the units that an agent may control may attempt move and to where, although the move may not
resolve as expected; units may not get as far as they had hoped, moving 0 to n - m.

Encountering food changes if the agent has food or not and causes new food to grow somewhere else.
