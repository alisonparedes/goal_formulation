    deal with a complete state, all n of its attributes.
    
    State must be a dictionary. Right now there may be two representations of states floating around, dictionaries and 2D grids. There are functions that transform
    one format to the other but which functions prefer which versions? I don't want to worry about this but ... sigh.
