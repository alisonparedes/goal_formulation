Simulate expects the state of the world and the action the agent wishes to take in this world--its action may or may not
be fulfilled as the agent expected. The simulate function will return a new state of the
world and a set of observations for the agent to incorporate into its belief state. The problem module's transition
function will handle how the world changes.

    Takes a state (a starting collection of units(?), an action, and a world (grid)  and returns a new world. Transition may not always be possible.
