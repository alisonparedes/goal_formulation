    '''Spawn new rewards. What is the simplest way to spawn new rewards? Use the same model used for generating 
    inital real world (none yet). If I did have a model for generating the inital real world, what might it do? Maybe the similar
    to what I built for speculating about the world. For now, use the same model I built for speculating about the world--The 
    assumption is that the agent knows the real probability distribution (or his estimate is unbiased :). This model lives in
    the world module right now.
