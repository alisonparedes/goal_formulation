    Expects a 2D array of probability distributions determined by the problem. 
    Example [(0.5,(0,1),'F'),(0.5,None)]
    
    N is the number of new cells to sample.
    
    Assumptions:

    A seed could help debug these functions but I don't think it can be used to debug search since search
    needs to speculate about different models.
