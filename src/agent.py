   A belief state is made up of 1) a collection of coordinates and their contents, 2) the amount of reward collected so
   far and 3) the condition of having food. Coordinates could be implemented as a list of tuples instead of a
   dictionary, and operators would wrap and unwrap coordinates using either the coordinate as the key. The amount of
   reward collected is an integer. The condition of having food or not is either True or False.
